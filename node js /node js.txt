Event Driven Architecture

EDA is a system design patten where systems communicate and react eevnt asynchronosouly 


Role and Responsibility
-----------------------------

*"As a Node.js Developer, I design and develop backend services using Express.js and Nest.js, ensuring scalable and efficient API structures. I work with both SQL and NoSQL databases, optimizing queries and implementing caching strategies. Security is a priority, so I implement JWT authentication, role-based access control, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.

I also focus on performance improvements, using worker threads and clustering for better concurrency. Additionally, I integrate unit tests with Jest and automate deployments with Docker and CI/CD pipelines.

By optimizing API performance and reducing database load, I helped decrease response times by 40%, enhancing user experience. I enjoy solving backend challenges and building high-performance applications."*
